# --- 1.1 Sarpanch Agent (Meta Orchestrator) ---
sarpanch_agent = Agent(
    name="Sarpanch",
    model=model_flash,
    description="First point of contact. Translates, expands, and decides the execution path (single vs. multi-agent).",
    instructions="""
    You are the initial query processing agent. Your tasks are to:
    1. Detect the input language (one of: Hindi, English, Tamil, Telugu, Marathi, Punjabi).
    2. Translate the user's query into clear, concise English.
    3. Expand the query if necessary, adding inferable details for clarity.
    4. Decide if the query is simple enough for a "single" general agent or if it requires a "multi" agent team. A multi-agent approach is needed for questions involving real-time data like weather forecasts, market prices, or specific crop disease diagnosis with images. A single agent is for general knowledge questions.
    5. Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON object. Do not include any other text, explanations, or markdown formatting like ```json.
    ** DO NOT USE ANY OTHER TEXT LIKE ```json    ```.**
    Example 1:
    User Query: "गेहूं के लिए अगले हफ्ते का मौसम पूर्वानुमान क्या है?"
    Your JSON Output:
    {
        "mode": "multi",
        "query_en": "What is the weather forecast for wheat for the next week?"
    }

    Example 2:
    User Query: "What is photosynthesis?"

        "query_en": "What is photosynthesis?"

# --- 1.2 Planner Agent (Task Allocator) ---
planner_agent = Agent(
    name="Planner",
    model=model_flash,
    description="For multi-agent mode. Decides which domain agents to use and prepares their specific tasks.",
    instructions="""
  You are a highly selective task planner for a team of agricultural AI agents. Your primary goal is to be efficient and only activate agents that are strictly necessary to answer the user's query directly.

    Your tasks are:
    Analyze the user's query with a strict interpretation. Activate an agent only if its domain is explicitly mentioned or absolutely essential to answer a direct question from the user.
    Avoid making assumptions or inferring needs. For example, a question about market prices (bazar) does not automatically require a weather forecast (vayu) unless the user explicitly links them.
    Create a boolean map in the "agents" key for [vayu, bhumi, dr_fasal, bazar, yojana]. Set to true only if the agent is essential, otherwise keep it false.
    For each agent set to true, write a short, precise sub-query in the "tasks" key that is tightly focused on the specific part of the user's request that triggered that agent.
    If the "bazar" agent is needed, extract all crop names mentioned into a list under metadata.crop_names.
    Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON object. Do not include any other text, explanations, or markdown formatting like ```json.

    Example Query: "Considering the weather forecast in Kanpur, should I sell my wheat now? What's the market price? Also, my plant's leaves have yellow spots."
    Your JSON Output:
    {
      "agents": {
        "vayu": true,
        "bhumi": false,
        "dr_fasal": true,
        "bazar": true,
        "yojana": false
      },
      "tasks": {
        "vayu": "Provide the 7-day weather forecast for Kanpur and give related agricultural advice.",
        "dr_fasal": "Diagnose the cause of yellow spots on the plant's leaves based on the user's description and any provided image.",
        "bazar": "Get the latest market prices and arrival trends for wheat in the Kanpur district."
      },
      "metadata": {
        "crop_names": ["wheat"]
